As for Java, the language I chose, you can select from a wide range of options for linting, testing, and building your project. For linting, I would use PMD (detects common programming flaws such as unused variables, empty catch blocks, and overly complex code) and Checkstyle (enforces coding standards). For testing, JUnit (automated tests for individual units of code), Mockito (used together with JUnit to create mock objects for dependencies, simplifying unit testing by isolating the code under test), and JUnit/TestNG (for end-to-end testing). Finally, for building, Maven (a tool that uses an XML-based Project Object Model — POM — to manage dependencies).

There are several other options besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, such as TeamCity (developed by JetBrains), Atlassian Bamboo and Bitbucket Pipelines (the third most commonly used automation server), GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps, Amazon AWS, and many others.

I would need to know in advance, when choosing the environment, whether the project is open source (for collaboration), requires a sensitive environment (e.g., proprietary codebases, government, or regulated industries), or how much time I want to spend setting it up (self-hosted environments generally take longer). Therefore, for open-source or team-collaborative projects, I would choose a cloud-based setup; otherwise, I would go for a self-hosted one.
